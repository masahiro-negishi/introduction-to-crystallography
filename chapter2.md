From the table above, it's obvious that $\{1, -1, i, -i\}$ is closed under the multiplication.
The associativity holds because the binary operation is the normal multiplication between numbers.
$1$ is the identity element.
For every row and column, there is one $1$, so the inverse element exists for every element of the group.

$\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under summation, since the sum of integers is always an integer.
The associativity obviously holds.
$0$ is the identity element, and the inverse element of the integer $a$ is $-a$.

It's a bit surprising that the combination of two rotations always results in another rotation, i.e., this set of 60 elements is closed.
